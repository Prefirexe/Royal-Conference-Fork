 canal_dividends.1.d: "A merchant vessel didn't pay attention and accidentally ran aground in the canal, blocking the way and making the passage more dangerous until completely cleared."
 canal_dividends.1.f: "The large trading ship lies half tilted in the canal, on its side a gashing wound from the impact with the wall, its goods spilled across the passage, finery and exotic wares bobbing in the water, the expensive merchandise of a foreign land soaked and ruined.\n\nOn the shore stands the captain, his face in his hands and his hat floating in the canal. Next to him the company's insurance representative holding a water damaged ship manifest trying to make sense of it all, while a canal agent tries to explain that the clearing might take months."
