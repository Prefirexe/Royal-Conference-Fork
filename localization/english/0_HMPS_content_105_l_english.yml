The #bold Progress Bar#! reaching #variable 100%#! will lead to succesful completion of the Army Reforms, phasing out the old #bold Banner System#! and the #bold Green Standard Army#! and making way for the introduction of the #bold New Army#!. \n\nPredating the Jurchen conquest of China and the establishment of the Qing dynasty, the Eight Banners have a long history as a warrior class and have over the centuries been vital for cementing Qing control over China. However powerful institutions grow decadent and the Banners are no exception. Centuries of prosperity have turned the rough steppe riders into gambling-addicted theatergoers. \n\nThe Green Standard army is an army made up of native Han Chinese people, who were initially instrumental in keeping the peace in Northern China. As the need for policing expanded, they managed to spread their influence throughout all of China. Although nowhere near as influential as the Banners, they have so far made the establishment of a formal police force seem unneccessary. Any policing law other than [GetLawType('law_no_police').GetName] will suspend Green Standard activity.  \n\nIf [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetName] is to survive, the army must be reformed, thus the Banners must be dealt with."
